This is a compiled Python 3.5 distribution with many libraries in it.  It's for actually deploying Python code .py as an executable on a machine that does not have Python installed.  In this manner, you can create Python programs for whatever purpose and distribute across an organization.  It's mostly mathematical libraries using MKL, Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, and Tkinter interface for a GUI.  There is also an encryption program so that the .py scripts can be deployed with a secret key (set by you) and unreadable to any users.  Made for convenience and protects the safety of proprietary code.
